Detection of the ball and determination of its center coordinates. Using the background subtraction algorithm in the mixture of Gaussians type with enabled shadow detection. Application of morphological operations to improve the mask. Condition of detection: the contour should be larger than a specified value and have the appropriate circularity.

Internal and external calibration, estimation of the camera matrix, distortion coefficient, rotation, and translation vectors calculated in order to determine the center's coordinates.
